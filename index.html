          <p>The computer architecture unit for computer science students at the University of Bristol is taught using a set of basic hardware boards coined buildacomp modules. The students learn about their inner workings and then use them to create bigger computing circuits. Finally, at the end of the course, they use them to create a fully functional computer processor similar to <a href="https://bighexmachine.github.io/">this one</a> that sits the in The Merchant Venturers building at the University.
          <p>Naturally, as the circuit designs get larger it becomes impractical to use the actual hardware, so a simulator was needed. <b>Enter Modulesim!</b>
          <p>You can download the latest version's runnable jar file from the release page <a href="https://github.com/uobteachingtechnologist/ModuleSim/releases">here</a>
          <p>To run it, you must have java installed on you computer. You can either launch it via the command line/terminal using <code>java -jar whatever_you_called_the_downloaded_file.jar</code> or in your file explorer you can just double click on the file and select open with java in the context menu.
          <p>If you find any bugs in the software feel free to either let us know in the github issues section of the repository or try a fix yourself and make a pull request.
